# steam-priority-picker
A simple tool that analyzes your Steam library, fetches game lengths from HowLongToBeat, gathers review scores, and generates a sorted list of “short &amp; high-rated” games. Perfect for deciding what to play next by prioritizing quick, high-quality experiences. Games without HLTB data are automatically ignored.
